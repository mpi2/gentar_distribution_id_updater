# gentar_distribution_id_updater
gentar_distribution_id_updater is a Python application designed to facilitate the process of adding RRIDs to the distribution table in a GenTaR database using an API. 
The application allows users to download it from GitHub and run it locally. Users are required to provide a list of colony names and corresponding RRIDs in a tab-separated format.
The primary purpose is to identify the colony ID associated with each colony name, and then use this colony ID to update the distribution table with the new RRID.

This project was written using python 3.9.0
and has been tested on OSX

## 1. Check your python installation:

```
python --version
or
python3 --version
```

## 2. Create a virtual environment for the project (requires Python 3.4+)

```
cd <name_of_cloned_github_repository>
python -m venv venv
or
python3 -m venv venv
```

## 3. To begin using the virtual environment, it needs to be activated:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

## 4. Install the packages required for the project

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
## 5. Prepare to run the program.

### A) Edit the rr_ids.txt file.

Add  colony name and rr ids tab(\t) seperated to be inserted on a separate line and save the file.
and RRid has to start with "RRID:" e.g.
```
jr34077\tRRID_MMRRC_048962-UCD
jr34078\tRRID_MMRRC_048963-UCD
```
### B) Export environment variable with your user credential.
```
export GENTAR_USER=<username>
export GENTAR_PASSWORD=<gentar_password>
```
### C) Specify the service to update.
```
export GENTAR_ENV=SANDBOX
```
Note: You can use the <a href="https://www.gentar.org/production-tracker-sandbox/#/">SANDBOX</a> to test the update.
Use "export GENTAR_ENV=PRODUCTION" to update the main service.

## 6. Invoke the program
```
python insert_rrid_by_colony.py
or
python3 insert_rrid_by_colony.py
```
This will produce the following sort of output
```
Processing jr34077\tRRID_MMRRC_048962-UCD
Successfully Updated: jr34077\tRRID_MMRRC_048962-UCD
```
If the colony cannot be updated  you will only see the line stating that the  404 Client Error In this case, edit the colonies file to correct the name or remove the line and then restart the program.
.If you see 401 Client Error please check your credential.
## 7. Once you have finished working in the virtual environment clean up

```
deactivate
```

This puts you back to the systemâ€™s default Python interpreter
with all its installed libraries.
